# Dedupe — Local Gemini-style Media Duplicate Finder
## Goal
Build a local app that scans a folder (and subfolders) for **duplicate and near-duplicate media** — primarily **images, videos, and GIFs** — with a Gemini 2–inspired workflow: pick folders → scan → review groups → smart-select → safely remove extras.

* * *
## Product principles (what Gemini 2 does well)
| Gemini 2 concept | Our equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Exact duplicates | Byte-identical files (content hash) |
| Similar files | Visually near-identical media (perceptual hash) |
| Smart Select | Rules to auto-keep one file per group |
| Thumbnail + list review | Side-by-side preview of each group |
| Safe removal | Move to Trash / quarantine folder (never hard-delete by default) |
| Folder-scoped scan | User points at one or more root folders |

**Out of scope for v1** (can add later): Photos.app library integration, iTunes/Music library, live “duplicates monitor”, cross-drive background daemon, Smart Select machine-learning from user habits.

* * *
## Target UX flow
1. **Select folders** — one or more roots to scan (recursive by default).
  
2. **Configure** — file types, exact vs similar, similarity threshold, exclusions.
  
3. **Scan** — progress (files found, hashed, groups so far, ETA).
  
4. **Results** — **Exact**, **Similar**, and optional **AI review candidates**.
  
5. **Review** — each group as thumbnails + metadata (path, size, dimensions, modified date).
  
6. **Select** — Smart Select rules or manual checkboxes.
  
7. **Act** — move selected files to Trash or a chosen folder; optional dry-run report.
  

Safety rails:

- Never delete without explicit confirm.
  
- Default action = Trash (recoverable), not permanent delete.
  
- Always keep at least one file per group.
  
- Dry-run mode that only reports.

## Detection pipeline
### Stage 1 — Inventory
Walk roots recursively, skip symlinks and hidden files by default, enforce scan-root containment, and respect exclusion globs.

Supported media (v1):

| Bucket | Extensions |
| --- | --- |
| Images | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.heic`, `.webp`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.bmp`, `.raw` (best-effort) |
| GIFs | `.gif` (treated as image for hashing; listed separately in UI) |
| Videos | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.mts` |

Collect metadata: path, size, mtime, extension, mime, dimensions (when cheap).
### Stage 2 — Exact duplicates
1. Bucket by **file size** (same size is a necessary condition).
  
2. For multi-file size buckets, compute **partial hash** (first 64KB) then full **SHA-256** if still tied.
  
3. Group files with identical full hash → **Exact Duplicate** sets.
  

Fast, exact, works for any binary including video/GIF.
### Stage 3 — Similar media (visual)
Only for files **not** already claimed as exact duplicates of each other (or run independently — configurable).

**Images / GIFs**

- Decode with Pillow (+ `pillow-heif` for HEIC).
  
- Compute perceptual hashes: **pHash** (primary) + **dHash** (secondary), via `imagehash`.
  
- Index hashes in a BK-tree (`pybktree`) for fast Hamming-distance search.
  
- Default threshold: Hamming distance ≤ 6 on 64-bit pHash (tunable slider: Strict → Loose).
  
- Optional: require agreement from dHash within a looser threshold to cut false positives.
  

**Videos**

- Sample N frames with **ffmpeg** (e.g. 1 fps or fixed 8–16 evenly spaced frames).
  
- Hash each frame; combine into a video fingerprint (XOR / majority / ordered frame-hash sequence).
  
- Compare fingerprints with Hamming / sequence distance.
  
- Fallback: if ffmpeg unavailable, only exact-hash video duplicates.
  

**GIF**

- Hash first frame + every Nth frame (or middle frame for short GIFs) so animated look-alikes group correctly.
  
### Stage 4 — Grouping & ranking
Each group:

- **Members**: 2+ paths
  
- **Kind**: `exact` | `similar`
  
- **Media type**: image / gif / video
  
- **Suggested keep**: highest resolution × largest bytes × newest mtime (weighted), preferring shorter path depth as soft tie-break
  
- **Space reclaimable**: sum(sizes) − size(suggested keep)
  

* * *
## Smart Select rules (v1)
| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Automatic (default)** | Keep suggested keep; select rest for removal |
| **Keep newest** | Keep latest mtime |
| **Keep oldest** | Keep earliest mtime |
| **Keep largest** | Keep biggest file (bytes / resolution) |
| **Keep smallest** | Keep smallest file |
| **Keep shortest path** | Prefer shallower / simpler path |
| **Deselect all** | Manual only |
| **Invert** | Flip selection within group |

User can override any selection before acting.

```
### Why Python + a localhost web UI for v1
- Python provides Pillow, ImageHash, OpenCV, ffmpeg orchestration, hashing, and safe Trash support.
  
- A loopback-only Flask UI provides a richer side-by-side review surface while keeping media local.
  
- Mutating API calls require a per-launch token and current scan generation; the server rejects cross-origin writes.
  

Alternative considered and deferred:

- Electron/Tauri: prettier UI, heavier install.
  
- Pure CLI: useful, but Gemini-like review needs previews.
  
### Persistence
- **SQLite cache** under `~/.cache/dedupe/`: algorithm version + path + device/inode + size + nanosecond mtime → sha256/phash/video fingerprint.
  
- Invalidate cache entry when size or mtime changes.

## Performance notes
- Size-bucketing before hashing → most files never fully hashed.
  
- Parallel hash workers (thread pool for I/O, process pool optional for CPU-bound image decode).
  
- Hash cache makes second scan near-instant for unchanged trees.
  
- Video frame sampling capped (e.g. max 16 frames, max decode resolution 320px).
  
- Large folders: stream progress every N files; don't hold decoded images in memory.
  

* * *
## Safety rules (hard)
1. Never overwrite files.
  
2. Never hard-delete in v1 UI (Trash or move-to-folder only).
  
3. Always leave ≥1 file unselected per group unless user forces a documented override.
  
4. Dry-run must be first-class.
  
5. Revalidate identity and scan-root containment immediately before every action.

6. Log every action to a unique atomic receipt; support quarantine restoration from that receipt.
  

* * *

- Inventory walk
  
- Exact duplicate detection
  
- Image similar detection (pHash + BK-tree)
  
- Smart Select rules
  
- JSON report + dry-run
  
- Tests with fixture media
  
### Phase 2 — Video + GIF polish
- ffmpeg video fingerprints
  
- Animated GIF multi-frame hashing
  
- Cache layer
  
### Phase 3 — Local web UI
- Folder pick, progress, group browser, thumbnails
  
- Smart Select + Trash actions
  
- macOS `.command` launcher
  
### Phase 4 — Polish
- Incremental re-scan
  
- Exclusion globs / whitelist folders
  
- HTML export report
  
- Preference persistence

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| UI primary | **Local web UI** (browser-based review) |
| Similarity depth v1 | **Exact + image/GIF + video similar** from day one |
| Action model | **Trash or quarantine folder** |
| Similar scope | **Near-identical only** (not loose look-alikes) |
| Package / CLI name | `dedupe` |
  

* * *
## Success criteria (v1)
- Point at a folder with known planted duplicates; finds 100% of byte-identical media.
  
- Finds near-duplicate JPEGs that differ only in quality/export settings (perceptual).
  
- Smart Select never marks the sole remaining unique file in a group for removal.
  
- Trash actions are reversible via Finder Trash.
  
- Re-scan of same tree uses cache and is meaningfully faster.
  
- Usable on a multi-GB photo/video dump without OOM.
  

* * *
## Non-goals (v1)
- Cloud / network protocol scanning as first-class
  
- Photos.app library direct integration
  
- Audio fingerprinting
  
- Background always-on monitor
  
- Paid Mac App Store packaging
